**Today's Progress**: Created Tribute Page for Leonard Cohen

**Thoughts:** After ten hours of free code camp and a crash course in what to do with a blinking sparse editor cursor staring straight at you. I feel I have light years to go but I am ready for the challenge!

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Experimented with bootstrap, jumbotron, adding images in jumbotron container, font styles etc. I have a lot of work ahead of me but it's fun to work out the problems. How did developers do this without google?
