**Today's Progress**: Created Tribute Page for Leonard Cohen

**Thoughts:** After ten hours of free code camp and a crash course in what to do with a blinking sparse editor cursor staring straight at you. I feel I have light years to go but I am ready for the challenge!

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal portfolio page

**Thoughts:** Experimented with bootstrap, jumbotron, adding images in jumbotron container, font styles etc. I have a lot of work ahead of me but it's fun to work out the problems. How did developers do this without google?

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Created first webpage, which I am extremely proud of because I used my own snarky humour with design. I am addicted to coding. I can't stop. I won't stop. I have found my purpose. OH, so this exercise came out of a class project at epicodus that I typed up in markdown language. Then I thought it would be cool to create an html version. So, I did and I also learned how to load index.html files to a webhost service. 

**Thoughts:**  It's 4:38 in the morning and I am not the least tired. I still want to code. WOW
